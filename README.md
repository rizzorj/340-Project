Problem Statement
The ISAT major is such a diverse major that it is often difficult to figure out what classes to take, where we can get help if needed in a class, know if you have made the requirements to be in an ISAT major, and what future careers people that have graduated from an ISAT major have gotten. The website that we would like to create incorporates all of this along with a location where you can plug in your classes to see if you will be able to graduate on time due to the large number of people that come into the ISAT major as sophomores and juniors. This website will contain more in depth descriptions for the sectors along with the 400 level classes which will ease the decision in which path to take along with what classes to take. With the help of Paul Henriksen and our academic advisor, the site will also include what career paths have been taken before with the specific concentrations along with resume help and packets. This will improve our alumni network and will better prepare the ISAT students for future internships and careers. This website will also include information for the ISAT Honor Society and when the tutoring hours are and class location for the week so students are easily able to seek help if need be. This website is meant to be the go to place for any ISAT questions and help to better specify what one wants to do with an ISAT major.
